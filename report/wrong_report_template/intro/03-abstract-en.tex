In this report, we propose a combined solution to collect and detect both the heart rate and the obstruction sleep apnea using only vibration signals measured at the patientâ€™s neck. Our proposed wearable device can capture vibration signals caused by the respiratory activities and the blood flows in the common carotid artery (CCA) and the internal jugular vein (IJV) on the patient's neck area during sleeping. The data are sent to a host computer via Bluetooth connection and stored in a database for further analysis. Our system is accurate and low-cost for capturing the desired signals. Moreover, the paper approach also goes deeper into signal processing by using a combination of the Wavelet Decomposition and other techniques to extract the heart rate from the vibration of the carotid artery and the jugular. We also propose a deep learning method for detecting the apnea state of a monitored patient using the Long Short-Term Memory network. In our initial experiments, the proposed algorithms obtain positive achievements
